# Movie Recommender Tool

This is a movie recommender tool created in Python 3 to be used in the terminal.
It recommends highly recommended movies based on IMDb data from April 2023. The user can filter the results by the following criteria: Genre, length and decade released.
Simply follow the on-screen instructions using the keyboard, and the top ten movies matching your criteria will be displayed in a table.

## Background

This tool was created as a project forming part of my Codecademy computer science course.

## Instructions and Files

This tool runs in Pyton 3 and requires the modules "pandas" and "tabulate".

To run the tool, first download the repository from github, then run Script.py from the main directory in Python:

```bash
$ python -m Script
```

The recommender function itself is stored in the RecommenderFunction.py file, and reads the data from the Database.tsv.
Database.py was used to originally create the Database.tsv file from the IMDb data, and is not longer part of the active program. It remains as reference.
