# Movie Recommender Tool

This is a movie recommender tool created in Python to be used in the terminal.
It recommends movies highly rated on IMDb based on user selected critera: Genre, length and decade released.

## Background

This tool was created as a project forming part of my Codecademy computer science course.

## Instructions and Files

To run the tool, execute the Script.py file in Python 3.
The recommender function itself is stored in the RecommenderFunction.py file.
Database.py was used to originally create the Database.tsv file from the IMDb data, and is not longer part of the active program.
